# Website-Spam-Opener
A program to mess around your friends with, as the repo name says, it spam opens websites.

## Usage
Run this file on your friend's computer/laptop in console mode, and watch them react to the craziness (trust me, real fun xD)

## Note
- Iâ€™ve added a few websites that apply to the program for developers (new links can be added or be removed)
- The program will randomly open a link every 5 seconds (the time can be changed)

## Requirements 
- Python
- Webbrowser Module (built-in module)
- Time Module (built-in module)
- Random Module (built-in module)
